Program 1

How I did it:
This program in my opinion was easier to accomplish than the previous homework.
The video that showed the completed version of the Linked List V2 project was a major 
assistance in completing this homework. Most of my code was derived from the Linked List
classwork which helped tremendously. From now own, linked lists will not be frightening.

What it does:
This program appends, inserts and deletes nodes into and from its list.
Nodes are comprised of a pointer to the next node and previous node in the list
along with a pet which is comprised of an id, type, name and age.
The list can be displayed forwards and backwards.
